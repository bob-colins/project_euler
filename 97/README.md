# [Large non-Mersenne prime](http://projecteuler.net/problem=97)

The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 2<sup>6972593</sup> ![−](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_minus.gif)1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2<sup><i>p</i></sup> ![−](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_minus.gif)1, have been found which contain more digits.

However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433 ![×](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)2<sup>7830457</sup>+1.

Find the last ten digits of this prime number.
