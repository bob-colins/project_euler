# [Pandigital products](http://projecteuler.net/problem=32)

We shall say that an <var>n</var>-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to <var>n</var> exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 ![Ã—](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif) 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
