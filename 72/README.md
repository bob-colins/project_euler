# [Counting fractions](http://projecteuler.net/problem=72)

Consider the fraction, _n/d_, where _n_ and _d_ are positive integers. If _n_ ![<](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_lt.gif)_d_ and HCF(_n,d_)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for _d_ ![≤](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.

How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions for _d_ ![≤](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) 1,000,000?
