# [Sum square difference](http://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 ![âˆ’](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_minus.gif) 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
