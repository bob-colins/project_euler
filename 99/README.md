# [Largest exponential](http://projecteuler.net/problem=99)

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2<sup>11</sup> and 3<sup>7</sup> is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2<sup>11</sup> = 2048 ![<](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_lt.gif) 3<sup>7</sup> = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382<sup>518061</sup> ![>](/Volumes/HDD_KS/source/project_euler/vender/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/euler-manager-0.1.1/config/../data/images/symbol_gt.gif) 519432<sup>525806</sup> would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using [base\_exp.txt](project/base_exp.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
